# Weather-Prediction
The Weather Forecast Prediction project is focused on building a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict weather conditions based on historical meteorological data. This project employs PyTorch as the deep learning framework, leveraging its flexibility and powerful tools to design, train, and evaluate the LSTM model. The goal is to predict future weather conditions by analyzing patterns in the past weather data, specifically focusing on four key features: mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.                                           
### Features

### Applications 
* Accurate weather forecasts enable farmers to make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, 
  and harvesting. By predicting temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather events, farmers can 
  optimize their agricultural practices to improve crop yield and reduce losses.
* Forecasts for severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and blizzards are 
  crucial for disaster preparedness and response. Accurate predictions allow authorities and 
  organizations to implement timely evacuation plans, issue warnings, and mobilize resources.
*Weather forecasts are vital for managing energy production and consumption, particularly for 
 renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Accurate weather predictions help in 
 optimizing energy grid operations and planning energy storage.
